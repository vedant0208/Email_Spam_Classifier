## Email_Spam_Classifier


I recently developed an Email Spam Classifier using Python and machine learning techniques.The project aimed to

# 1) Data Preparation and Exploration:

Loaded the dataset and performed initial data cleaning and preprocessing.

Visualised the data to understand the distribution and patterns.

# 2) Text Processing:

Utilised nltk for text processing tasks such as tokenisation, stemming, and stopword removal.

Applied TF-IDF vectorisation to convert text data into numerical format for model training.

# 3) Model Training:

Trained multiple classification models including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Stacking Classifier.

Evaluated models using accuracy and precision metrics to select the best-performing one.

# 4) Hyperparameter Tuning:

Implemented GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters for the models, enhancing their performance.

# 5) Model Evaluation:

Assessed the final model on the test set, achieving high accuracy and precision in spam detection.

Visualised model performance using bar plots to compare different algorithms.

# 6) Model Deployment:

Saved the trained TF-IDF vectorizer and the model using pickle for future use in deployment.

This project not only honed my skills in natural language processing and machine learning but also demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble methods in classification tasks.
